# The Dev Akimbo Manifesto

Akimbo is an ancient word, which is a symbol of strength, and possibility. It's believe that when we stand tall, arms bend, looking straight, we are able to make a difference.

As a Akimbo Developers, we are pround of our craft, and we know our work matters.

## Who we are

We are developers who care, not only about crafting great code but about crafting lifes worth living for our families, for community and for ourselves. ✌️

We don't point fingers at others laughing when they make a mistake, we help them growth and become better programmer and human being. We want win-win relationships, nothing less. ✌️

We are commited to build IT career, giving our best selves. But we won't let to be used, or sold as a commodity on the market.

We won't let random people be the masters of our lifes. We claim control of our lifes, and our families future.✊🤝

We gonna plan our careers in the way we will be where we want to be, earn what we want to earn and spend time with people we choose.

Vim, Emacs, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Abrakadabra Editor doesn't matter. PHP, Ruby, Java, Javascript doesn't matter. We are all developers, and we are all want to do our best. We will not waste our talents and our precious time for miningless holy wars and trolling. We are better than that, there are more important things that really matters. 🙌
